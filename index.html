            <p>Monkey D. Luffy  also known as "Straw Hat" Luffy, is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the One Piece manga series, created by Eiichiro Oda. Luffy made his debut in One Piece Chapter #1 as a young boy who acquires the properties of rubber after accidentally eating the supernatural Gum-Gum Fruit, one of the so-called Devil Fruits.

                Born on May 5, Luffy dreamed of being a pirate since childhood. At the age of 17, Luffy sets sail from the East Blue Sea to the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure, One Piece, to succeed Gol D. Roger as "King of the Pirates". Luffy, captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, recruits crew members Roronoa Zoro, Nami, Usopp, Sanji, Tony Tony Chopper, Nico Robin, Franky, Brook, and Jimbei. He fights antagonists, and aids and befriends the inhabitants of several islands on his journey. Usually cheerful, he becomes serious and even aggressive when he fights. Luffy uses his elasticity to concentrate his power, executing a range of attacks. In his signature attack, Gum-Gum Pistol, he slingshots punches at opponents from a distance. Luffy also grows stronger over the course of the story, as reflected in his "bounty", which is used to measure the threat he poses to the World Government. He is the grandson of Monkey D. Garp, who is a vice-admiral; and the son of Monkey D. Dragon, who is the leader of the Revolutionary Army, but was raised by his foster mother, Curly Dadan, who is the leader of mountain bandits,meeting his adopted brothers, Portgas D. Ace and Sabo, in their childhood.
                
                Luffy appears in most of the episodes, films, television specials, and OVAs of the manga's anime adaptations and several of the franchise's video games. Due to the series' international popularity, Luffy has become one of the world's most recognizable anime characters. In addition to the One Piece franchise, the character has appeared in a number of manga and anime series and collaborative video games. His critical reception has been largely positive.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">Born in Foosha Village, Luffy accidentally ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi at age 7, which turned his body into rubber. He also met "Red-Haired" Shanks, who owned and gave Luffy the very Straw Hat that has become Luffy's signature accessory, having gifted it to the boy as part of a promise for them to meet again someday. Luffy is the son of the Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon, the grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp, the sworn brother of late "Fire Fist" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary Chief-of-Staff Sabo, and the foster son of Curly Dadan. He is one of the few people in the world that carry the Will of D.

                Luffy has gone up against numerous global powers around him, starting with fighting the most powerful pirates in the East Blue and moving to clashes against the Marines, Seven Warlords of the Sea, World Nobles, and even the Four Emperors in the Grand Line; emerging victorious in a majority of these battles. Luffy's accomplishments and heritage have caused him to be labeled as a "Dangerous Future Element", earning the wrath of Fleet Admiral Sakazuki, the Marine Headquarters, and even the World Government. Luffy also has a penchant for attracting followers and has unwillingly been named the leader of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, consisting of seven pirate crews who swore to come to his aid whenever he wishes. After learning of this and his exploits against the Big Mom Pirates, the press has labeled him the "Fifth Emperor of the Sea", though many prominent figures consider this to be exaggerated.
                
                These acts, among other things, have given him his current bounty of Beli.png1,500,000,000. Having had a bounty of Beli.png300,000,000 before he arrived at the Sabaody Archipelago, Luffy is one of eleven rookie pirates who simultaneously reached the Red Line with bounties over Beli.png100,000,000 which was received from the situation in Arabasta, a group which would go on to be referred to as the "Worst Generation", with the addition of a twelfth</span></p>
